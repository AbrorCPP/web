            Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for
            HBO. It is the first adaptation of the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise, a series of high fantasy novels by
            George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show premiered on HBO in the United States
            on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.

            Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows
            several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the
            Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families, either vying to
            claim the throne or fighting for independence. The second major arc focuses on the last descendant of the
            realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the
            throne. The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from
            beyond the Seven Kingdoms' northern border.

            Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international fan base.
            Many critics and publications have named the show one of the greatest television series of all time. Critics
            have praised the series for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although
            its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) generated controversy. The final season
            received significant criticism for its reduced length and creative decisions, with many considering it a
            disappointing conclusion. The series received 59 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series,
            including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. Its other awards and nominations include
            three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, a Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden Globe
            Award for Best Television Series – Drama.
